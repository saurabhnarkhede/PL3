        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/vladimir_putin_601185" >
           We need business to understand its social responsibility, that the main task and objective for a business is not to generate extra income and to become rich and transfer the money abroad, but to look and evaluate what a businessman has done for the country, for the people, on whose account he or she has become so rich.
            ~ Vladimir Putin
